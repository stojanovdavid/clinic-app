This is my Pabau clinic-app project

When we open the app, we are shown the index page where we can see the navbar, and there we can either log in or sign up

After signing up, we can see that we are given the option to log out cause we are signed and logged in, and aswell, we see the dashboard where the doctor can see, add, edit or delete his patients

Firstly, adding a patient
After clicking on the button "Add new patient", we are given a modal with a form. When the doctor types the info about the patient and clicks the "Add patient" submit, the patient will be added in the table(this is done with ajax)

Then, by just clicking the "info" button, we get the info about the patient
